This will be my second file to the project. I am creating it to revise the steps of the life cycle of a file in Github.

This is the new content.

This is the second edit. Let's add the steps in a life cycle of a file in Github.
1. Add a file
2. Create a branch
3. Commit a file
4. Pull request
5. Make review changes, if any
6. Merge
7. Delete the branch

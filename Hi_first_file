Hi-world!

This is the first file in this project other than the README file. This file will hold information for different kinds of files that 
you can either create or import into Github. 

We will now create a branch to see what types of files I can import into Github. Let's go!

I tried out what all files you can imoprt into a Github project or as they call it upload to a project. For experimentation I added two files from my CockroachDB
setup; one file was .png and the other .ttf.

Now, let's commit these changes to the new branch and then open the pull request for reviewing the changes. Lastly, we will merge these changes in the main branch,
Hi-world. Let's go!
